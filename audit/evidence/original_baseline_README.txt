# TextVQA Qwen3-VL LoRA Baseline

This repository contains a small VLM fine-tuning baseline for TextVQA. The current implementation fine-tunes `Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct` with LoRA, but submissions may use any training structure or adaptation method.

**Deadline:** 3 days.

## Requirements

- Training must finish within 1 hour on 2080Ti (1 or 2 GPUs are both acceptable).
- Test-time latency and FLOPs must be no more than 1.1x the original base model.
- The submitted model may use LoRA, full fine-tuning, adapters, prompt tuning, or another method, as long as the evaluation budget is respected.
- Final results should be reported over 3 seeds.

The final submission should include:

- `README.md`
- `run_prepare.sh`
- `run_train.sh`
- `eval_qwen.sh`
- Merge script if needed, for example `run_merge_lora.sh` and `merge_lora.py`
- Any required config and source files used by those scripts

## Files

- `configs/vlm_textvqa_lora.yaml`: training configuration.
- `prepare_textvqa.py`: prepares and caches TextVQA prompts.
- `train_textvqa_qwen3vl.py`: LoRA fine-tuning script.
- `run_prepare.sh`: data preparation entrypoint.
- `run_train.sh`: 2-GPU training entrypoint.
- `run_merge_lora.sh`: merges a LoRA adapter into the base model.
- `eval_qwen.sh`: TextVQA evaluation entrypoint based on `lmms-eval`.

## Data And Model

The default config uses:

- **Model:** `Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct` (local path or Hugging Face)
- **Dataset:** TextVQA from Hugging Face (`lmms-lab/textvqa`). You can also point `data_path` in the config to local `*.parquet` files.

```yaml
model_path: Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct
data_path: lmms-lab/textvqa
```

Prepared data is saved under `data/prepared_textvqa_qwen3vl_seed{seed}`. Training outputs are saved under `outputs/textvqa_qwen3vl_lora_seed{seed}`.

The default prompt does not include dataset-provided OCR tokens.

## Base Model Performance

The original `Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct` (without fine-tuning) achieves the following on `textvqa_val`:

| Model | exact_match |
|-------|-------------|
| Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct | **69.84%** |

## Baseline (LoRA Fine-tuned) Performance

This LoRA fine-tuning baseline achieves the following on `textvqa_val` across 3 seeds:

| Seed | exact_match |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | 70.63%      |
| 2    | 70.73%      |
| 3    | 70.67%      |
| **Mean** | **70.68%** |

> This is a simple baseline. Students are expected to surpass this score. Achieving a comparable result with better code quality and innovative ideas is also acceptable.

> **Note on GPU environment:** The baseline results above were obtained using 2 GPUs. This is provided for reference only. If you only have a single-GPU environment, don't worry — we will fairly compare your code against this simple LoRA baseline using a single GPU as well.

## Setup

### Environment

You may use the pre-configured shared environment, or install dependencies yourself:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd lmms-eval && pip install -e . && cd ..
```

> If you install your own environment, **include your `requirements.txt`** in the submission.

### Coding Style

You are free to use any workflow (including vibe coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) as long as the submitted code is clean, reproducible, and runs correctly.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare data

```bash
SEED=1 bash run_prepare.sh
```

### 2. Train

```bash
SEED=1 bash run_train.sh
```

For 3 seeds:

```bash
for seed in 1 2 3; do
  SEED=$seed bash run_prepare.sh
  SEED=$seed bash run_train.sh
done
```

Training is controlled by `max_steps` and `max_train_seconds` in `configs/vlm_textvqa_lora.yaml`.

### 3. Merge LoRA

```bash
SEED=1 bash run_merge_lora.sh
```

The merged model is saved to `outputs/textvqa_qwen3vl_lora_seed1/merged` by default.

### 4. Evaluate

Evaluate the merged model:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=./outputs/textvqa_qwen3vl_lora_seed1/merged bash eval_qwen.sh
```

Evaluate the base model:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct bash eval_qwen.sh
```
